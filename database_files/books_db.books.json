Feathers defines legacy code as 'code without tests' and provides a toolkit of strategies for safely making changes and improvements. The book introduces the concept of 'seams,' which are places in the code where behavior can be altered without direct modification, allowing for the introduction of tests and incremental refactoring. Feathers offers practical techniques such as 'sprout method,' 'wrap method,' and dependency breaking to help developers isolate and test problematic code. The book is structured as a series of solutions to common challenges, such as adding features, fixing bugs, and refactoring without breaking existing functionality. Through real-world examples and clear explanations, Feathers empowers developers to transform legacy systems into maintainable, testable, and robust applications. This book is essential for anyone working in real-world software environments where perfect code is rare and continuous improvement is necessary.",

  "description": "1984 by George Orwell is a dystopian novel that explores the dangers of totalitarianism and extreme political ideology. Set in a future society ruled by the Party and its omnipresent leader, Big Brother, the story follows Winston Smith, a low-ranking member of the Party who secretly despises the regime.

The novel delves into themes of censorship, propaganda, psychological manipulation, and the nature of reality. Its concepts, such as 'doublethink' and 'thoughtcrime,' have entered the cultural lexicon. 1984 remains profoundly relevant, serving as a cautionary tale about the consequences of unchecked power and the importance of resisting oppression. It is widely regarded as one of the most important works of twentieth-century literature.",
